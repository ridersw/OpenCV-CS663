      Object detection is the technique in Computer vision that is used to
      identify the required object and locate them in the provided image or the
      video. The object detection module will usually draw a square box around
      the object after locating in the image [3]. <br /><br />

      />
      <br /><br />
      Before we proceed, I would like to clarify the difference between Object
      detection and Object recognition. The Object recognition will assign the
      label to the object while object detection will return True if object is
      detected in the image. There are two main object detection modes- Machine
      Learning based approaches and Deep-Learning based approaches.
      <br /><br />In the Machine Learning based approaches, computer vision uses
      the methods like color histogram or edges and other various features of
      the image to identify the pixel clusters that belong to the objects. The
      deep learning-based approaches usually use the convolutional neural
      networks to perform the end-to-end unsupervised object detection in which
      the features are defined and extracted altogether. <br /><br />The deep
      learning-based approach is used in most of the applications due to its
      flexibility and usability. Basic Structure of the Object Detection- The
      deep learning approach has 2 main parts, Encoder and Decoder. The encoder
      takes an image as inputs, passes through the CNN layers that learn to
      extract features. The output from the encoder is then passed to the
      decoder that predicts the bounding boxes and labels the detected
      object.<br /><br />

      <h3>Most Used Algorithm for Object Detection- YOLO</h3>
      <br />
      The YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a famous and most used object detection
      algorithm that works extremly fast in manner. The base YOLO object
      detection works on 45 fps speed while smaller version works on upto 155
      frames per second.

      />

      <br />

      The YOLO Detection System- <br />
      Step 1) YOLO resizes all the input images to 448 X 448<br />
      Step 2) Runs a single convolutional network on the image.<br />
      Step 3) Thresholds the resulting detections by the model's confidence.<br />
