      To implement the system for visually impaired, I would use the lightweight
      hardware that can be conveniently wearable. One such hardware combination
      can be done with Raspberry Pi [2]. The system proposed by Meghana and Team
      [2] used consists of a wearable device made of Raspberry Pi that reads out
      a destination signs on the public transport, recognize the signs and
      symbols, guides user to the locations and so on. The camera system can
      detect, recognize and assists the user the destination signs with up to 20
      mts (considering the size of the displays on public transport in CA and
      MA, USA). The total cost of the above setup is around USD $80. The above
      setup consists of the hardware as below-<br />

      https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/ This has a Sony
      IMX219 8-megapixel sensor that can be used to capture high-definition
      video as well as still-images. It can capture 1080p30, 720p60 and VGA90
      video modes, as well as still capture. It attaches via a 15cm ribbon cable
      to the CSI port on the Raspberry Pi.<br />
