      The visually impaired assistance system is complex system that heavily
      relies on the computer vision technologies to convey the environment
      information to the user and that too without any processing delay. The
      objective of this review paper is to introduce different methods/
      implementation that has been done in this field. The techniques discussed
      above would be able to detect the static and dynamic objects with
      classification.
