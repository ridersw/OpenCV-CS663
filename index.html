        Computer Vision for Partially/ Fully vision impaired by Shashiraj

      <h2 id="heading">Introduction</h2>
      The amount of work that has been implemented around the world for visually
      impaired for interacting with the environment is tremendous. With the
      number of 253 million visually impaired in the world [1], it becomes
      difficult and quite expensive to build/ modify the infrastructure to
      assist the visually impaired to ease their interactivity with the
      environment. The simple yet effective solutions like visual and audio
      traffic signals/ lights on the intersections, brail on the lifts, currency
      notes, etc. are already in place. But these are not sufficient to create a
      safe and ease to navigate environment. There are different types of public
      transport like bus, train, taxis and each of those have implemented
      different methods for destination signs like image below-

        style="height: 50%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"
