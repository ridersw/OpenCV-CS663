        <li>Can you define "digital image?"</li>
        <br />Answers- A digital image is a picture that's made up of smaller
        parts, called pixels. These pixels are made of numerical components that
        represent their color codes and intensity. AI systems us these numbers
        to understand an image.<br /><br />

        <li>What's the purpose of grayscaling?</li>
        <br />Answers- Grayscale is the range of whiteness to blackness of a
        digital image. Programmers take an image that's in color and change it
        to grayscale, which is called grayscaling. This helps simplify the image
        data so a computer can more easily process the input.<br /><br />

        <li>What is real time object detection?</li>
        <br />Answers- Real-time object detection is the task of doing object
        detection in real-time with fast inference while maintaining a base
        level of accuracy.<br /><br />

        <li>
          What are some of the machine learning algorithms you can use in
          OpenCV?
        </li>
        <br />Answers- There's a wide range of algorithms you can use for
        OpenCV, including k-nearest neighbor, convolutional neural networks,
        gradient boosting trees, random forest and decision tree learning. Since
        a lot of my experience is in resolving bugs, I use naive bayes to define
        class labels with values that I can return to at the end of an
        evaluation..<br /><br />
