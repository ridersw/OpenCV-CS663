      The Raspberry Pi system uses the ultrasonic sensors to detect the object,
      in our case/ problem, it would detect the public transport vehicle like
      bus or train and let user know the distance. The distance is calculated by
      the time difference between sensor transmits and receives the ultrasonic
      waves. These ultrasonic waves travel at speed of sound, approx. 343
      m/s.<br /><br />

      The Raspberry Pi camera module takes the picture of the public transport
      vehicle within approximate range and passes that still image to object
      detection and object recognition module. The module here would be
      responsible for text extraction and saving it to the text file. The OCR
      (Optical Character Recognition) feature by Google Cloud Vision API is one
      of the most efficient RESTful API for the application. <br /><br />Once
      the image is clicked, it can be stored in the local memory for specific
      time period and the name of the image is passed on the feature extraction
      and recognition. The text extracted from the image is then stored in the
      log file and the output is directed to the user via speaker/ headphones.
      All the modules mentioned in the above implementation work separately as
      they can be called as threads.
